This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Project

Developed during Rocketseat's Ignite's ReactJS track - Chapter IV - Next.JS + ChakraUI.
Topics: declarative interfaces using ChakraUI and NextJS, a 3h course.

## What was great?

The combo NextJS+ChakraUI makes it similar to Flutter development process. It brings an
interesting way to componetize and maintain code.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
